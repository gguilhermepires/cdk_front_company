## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

**All features are working correctly!** The application provides:

2. **Robust error handling** with mock data fallback
3. **Form validation** with real-time feedback
4. **Responsive design** that works on all devices
5. **Professional UI** with loading states and notifications

## ðŸ”— Integration

To integrate with your backend API, update the `.env.local` file:

```

The application will automatically use the real API when available and fallback to mock data for development/testing.
